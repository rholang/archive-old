Mono repo tooling
==========
Sub directory for the AFP decomp stream to use for creating mono repo tool.
These tools will eventually be moved to the tangerine github repo.
And possibly moved scopes as well.

# Why not use the `build/` dir
The build dir is mostly used for AK build tooling. The tooling in this directory is not necessarily for AK, but for our
consumers instead
