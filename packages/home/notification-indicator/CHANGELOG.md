## 7.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [patch][d0db01b410](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/d0db01b410):

  TypeScript users of withAnalyticsEvents and withAnalyticsContext are now required to provide props as a generic type. This is so that TypeScript can correctly calculate the props and defaultProps of the returned component.

  Before:

  ```typescript
  withAnalyticsEvents()(Button) as ComponentClass<Props>;
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  withAnalyticsEvents<Props>()(Button);
  ```
