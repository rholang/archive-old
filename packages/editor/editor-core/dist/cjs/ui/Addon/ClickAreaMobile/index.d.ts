/**
 * Click Area is responsible for improving UX by ensuring the user
 * can always tap beneath the content area, to insert more content.
 *
 * This is achieved by inserting a new empty paragraph at the end of
 * the document (if one doesn't already exist).
 *
 * This is particularly important when the content exceeds the visible
 * viewport height, and if the last content node captures text selection
 * e.g. table, layouts, codeblock, etc.
 *
 * This relies on the Scroll Gutter plugin which inserts addtional
 * whitespace at the end of the document when it overflows the viewport.
