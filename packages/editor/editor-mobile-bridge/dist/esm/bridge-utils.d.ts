 * Send an event to which ever bridge it can find.

 * @param eventName {string} event name
 * @param props {object} arguments passed
 *
 * For this to work on both bridges their interfaces need to match.
 *
 * We have two main identifiers we use, bridgeName and eventName.
 * For iOS this looks like:
 *  window.webkit.messageHandlers.<bridgeName>.postMessage({
 *    name: eventName,
 *    ...<props>
 *  })
 *
 * And for Android:
 * Props object is spread as args.
 *  window.<bridgeName>.<eventName>(...<props>)
