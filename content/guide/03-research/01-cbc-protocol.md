# CBC protocol

This description is based on Vlad Zamfir's correct-by-construction consensus protocols (see papers [here](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/papers/cbc-consensus/AbstractCBC.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/papers/CasperTFG/CasperTFG.pdf) for detailed descriptions) as well as discussions with Greg Meredith and others on the RChain development team. A simulation engine based on what is described on this page is being developed. The code is available on [RChain's GitHub](https://github.com/rchain/Casper-Proof-of-Stake/tree/simulation-dev/simulation).
