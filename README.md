Atlaskit is the technical implementation of the [Atlassian Design Guidelines][adg]. It is a collection of reusable components that can be downloaded independently into your projects. Each component is also independently versioned and published to npm.

The full list of components can be found in the [Atlaskit Registry][atlaskitregistry].

**This project is bound by a [Code of Conduct][codeofconduct].**

# Installation and usage

Atlaskit components and utilities are available as discrete npm packages.

The `@atlassiansox/analytics-web-client` package is a peer dependency as it is a private package and so must be installed alongside the tool.

#### Pre-requisites

It's strongly advised to use the Atlaskit CSS reset in your whole project, or some Atlaskit components
may diverge in appearance:

```javascript
import '@atlaskit/css-reset';
```

In general, you should avoid directly styling base elements (ex. p, h1, h2) and uses classes instead.

#### Example for React projects

Atlaskit components are built for React. Here's an example of using the Avatar component:

1. First, you specify a component into your project as a dependency using npm: `npm install @atlaskit/avatar`
2. Then you can use it in your React projects like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Avatar from '@atlaskit/avatar';

export default (
  <Avatar
    src="https://design.atlassian.com/images/avatars/project-128.png"
    presence="online"
    size="large"
  />
);
```

Check out the [Atlaskit Registry][atlaskitregistry] to learn more.

#### Example for non-React projects

There is a subset of components available as styles called the Reduced UI pack.
To use:

1. You include these into your the HTML projects.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/@atlaskit/css-reset@latest" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/@atlaskit/reduced-ui-pack@latest" />
```

2. Then you can style HTML with

`<button class="ak-button ak-button__appearance-primary">Submit</button>`

Check out the [Reduced UI pack](http://go.atlassian.com/reduced-ui-pack) for more examples and details.

#### Upgrading components
