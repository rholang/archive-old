While rholang is meant to be a general-purpose programming language, it's current role is as a blockchain language. Many wonderful smart contracts are being written in rholang . But people don't live their whole lives on-chain. They also go outside and ply, eat dinner, and go to concerts. And while they're away doing those real-world things, they need a place to store their unforgeable names. Because unforgeable names can only exist on the blockchain.\n\n\x3c!-- Julie drawing of unforgeable name not allowed to cross some line. --\x3e\n\n\n## Name Registry\nThe name registry provides a partial solution to the problem. To register a name follow this example.\n\n```javascript\nnew doubler,\n  uriChan,\n  insertArbitrary(`rho:registry:insertArbitrary`),\n  stdout(`rho:io:stdout`) in {\n\n   // This is a silly contract that we'll register\n  contract doubler(@n /\\ Int, return) = {\n    return!(2 * n)\n  } |\n\n  // Tell the registry that we want to register\n  // give URI back on uriChan\n  insertArbitrary!(bundle+{*doubler}  , *uriChan) |\n \n  // Wait for URI response\n  for(@uri <- uriChan) {\n    stdout!(uri)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\nTo look a name up to use it later, try this\n\n```javascript\nnew doublerCh,\n  lookup(`rho:registry:lookup`),\n  stdout(`rho:io:stdout`) in {\n  \n  // Ask the registry to lookup the URI and send the contract back on doublerCh\n  lookup!(`rho:id:fos1m8yaki3s8g1ytzkr6boucnhab6nafoco8ww63xqj5k8aa1xfza`, *doublerCh) |\n\n  // Wait to receive the answer back from the registry\n  for( doubler <- doublerCh) {\n    \n    // Double a number and send the answer to stdout\n    doubler!(7, *stdout)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere is also a feature called `insertSigned` which allows contract publishers to later update their contracts, but I have security concerns about it, so I won't document it here.\n\n## Cryptography\nThe name registry got us close to what we need. The remaining challenge is that now that names can be made publicly accessible, how do we ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensative contracts? Cryptography to the rescue!\n\n\nTODO This section is incomplete\n\nRholang has primitives for hashing and signature verification\n\nShow how to do a simple signature verified contract on a public name\nLink to RSign and RChain-API\n"}}]);
