Information about this process is not yet available.\n\n\n## Joining the RChain test net\nYou can join the RChain test net. Please see [RChain public testnet](https://rchain.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CORE/pages/678756429/RChain+public+testnet+information) information for details about the version of software and the bootstrap address.\n\n## Monitoring the Node\nRNode features integration with Prometheus. [These instructions](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/blob/master/docker/node/README.md) describe a method for getting started with RNode metrics collection and display using Prometheus via Docker-compose.\n\n## Visualizing the blockchain\nTo support debugging we have a process to collect information from the node and use it in graphviz to create a visualization of the DAG. Below are instructions for two methods for using this tool.\n\n## Visualizing the blockchain when there are >6,000 lines\nOnce an active network has been running for a few hours, your call to vdag will likely generate >6,000 lines of output. In this scenario, you will need to have installed the Graphviz software and use it to create a .png file. Please see https://www.graphviz.org/download/ for information about installing and running Graphviz.\n\nOnce installed use the following command to generate a .png file based on vdag output.\n\n```bash\nrnode vdag | dot -Tpng >vdag.png\n```\n\n## Creating a private blockchain\nYou can create your own blockchain network. \n\nPrerequisites for a private blockchain\n\n* 1 bootstrap node\n* 2 other node instances running on a network where they can communicate with each other (peers of each other). \n* Keys for the node instances (these will be required for signing and creating the bond.txt file)\n* A bond.txt file accessible by all node instances. You can either supply it, or use the system generated bonds file.\n* A Rholang file to deploy across the network.\n\nSteps to create a private blockchain\n\n* Start the bootstrap node. This is the 1 node operating in standalone mode.\n* Include the address of the bootstrap node in your run command for the peer nodes.\n"}}]);
